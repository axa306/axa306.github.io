 <h2>Intro</h2>
    <p>Hello, My name is Alexander Arevalo. I'm a senior undergraduate student at the University of Miami.
      I'm originally from the Washington DC area but moved to Miami to a few years ago to
      pursue my undergraduate degree. Some of my favorite hobbies inlcude traveling, hiking and practicing the piano.
      Having grown up in the Washington DC area, I enjoy watching the local sports team. I mostly follow the local football,
      baseball and basketball sports teams.</p>

      <p>Of all the sports I enjoy watching, I would say my favorite sport is football. I grew up a huge fan of the Washington Football Team.
        But despite having a favorite NFL team, I like to follow the careers of certain players throughout the NFL. I consider myself an avid fan of the sport in
        general and of the many great athletes whom play the game. With this website, I hope to give a summery of myself. Then, a ranking of my top-7 favorite
        football players of all time. And finally, a table with a few facts about the players.</p>
